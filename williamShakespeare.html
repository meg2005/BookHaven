        William Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is
        widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the
        world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national
        poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").<br />His extant
        works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets,
        three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain
        authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living
        language and are performed more often than those of any other
        playwright. His characters, such as Hamlet, Othello, Macbeth, and
        Juliet, are iconic and continue to be studied and performed worldwide.
        <br />
        Shakespeare's plays, a testament to his unparalleled skill, traverse
        three overarching genres: tragedies, exemplified by masterpieces such as
        "Hamlet" and "Othello"; comedies, where works like "A Midsummer Night's
        Dream" and "Twelfth Night" showcase his wit and humor; and histories,
        including compelling narratives like "Henry IV" and "Richard III," which
        delve into the annals of England's past. Additionally, his collection of
        154 sonnets delves into profound themes such as love, time, beauty, and
        mortality, showcasing the breadth of his poetic prowess.

        Despite living over 400 years ago, Shakespeare's impact on literature,
        drama, and the English language remains profound. His plays and poems
        are still widely read, studied, and performed, and his influence can be
        seen in various forms of art and entertainment
