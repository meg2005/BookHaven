        Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in
        his career about the romance between two Italian youths from feuding
        families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his
        lifetime and, along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed
        <br />Romeo and Juliet belongs to a tradition of tragic romances
        stretching back to antiquity. The plot is based on an Italian tale
        written by Matteo Bandello and translated into verse as The Tragical
        History of Romeus and Juliet by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in
        prose in Palace of Pleasure by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare
        borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number
        of supporting characters, in particular Mercutio and Paris.
        Shakespeare's use of poetic dramatic structure (including effects such
        as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, the
        expansion of minor characters, and numerous sub-plots to embellish the
        story) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill.
